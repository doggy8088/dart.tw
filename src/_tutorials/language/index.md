The Future and Stream classes provide API for performing tasks,
such as input/output, asynchronously, so as to avoid blocking your
program. Futures and streams are fundamental to most Dart programs.

- The futures tutorial has been replaced by a codelab:
  [Asynchronous programming: futures, async, await](/codelabs/async-await).
- The [streams tutorial](/tutorials/language/streams)
  tells you how to use streams to manage sequences of data.

For a guided, hands-on introduction to Dart concepts,
try one of the [Dart codelabs](/codelabs).
